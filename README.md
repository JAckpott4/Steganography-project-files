Original Files: these encompass the 10 original .jpeg and .txt files which make up the testing data, also includes the control data (text/image), and the cover image (.png). Descriptions of these files are found in the methodology section, Table II.

Stego-objects (uploaded): these are the .png images which are formed when embedding the Original Files (as above) into the cover image (as above). These are the Stego-objects, in the state by which they are uploaded to Weiyun (although file names are different here than they appear in Weiyun screenshots for readability).

Stego-objects (downloaded): these are the .png images (Stego-objects) in the state with which they are downloaded from Weiyun.

Extracted Payloads: these are the payload files (.jpeg and .txt) which are extracted, using the decoding algorithm, from the files outlined above (Stego-objects (downloaded)).
